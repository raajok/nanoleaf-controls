# Nanoleaf Controls

This project is for University of Turku course named Project II. The project is currently **under development**!

Nanoleaf Controls is an Electron desktop app to control [Nanoleaf](https://nanoleaf.me/) products. Frontend is created with React.
Effects can already be made with Nanoleaf's own apps, but an effect using 3rd party data has to be coded completely from scratch.

Nanoleaf Controls aims to implement the following features:
- Effect using weather data for the location of user's choice
- Effect using temperature of CPU
- Basic controls to connect/disconnect to the device as well as on/off
